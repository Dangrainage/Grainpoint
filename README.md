Remember Gunpoint?

Tom Francis' game about punching people, jumping and rewiring buildings? 
Well, I wanted to make my own. My first programming language was lua, so I decided to work In Love2D to make a bad knock off Gunpoint, and 8Bit, and *bad*.

I am "happy" with It so far, but I want to expand It further, the current version is heavy WIP.
For now the game includes: Walking, with animation, pouncing (jumping I guess, there's no one to pounce on yet), and "collisions" (for now It just detects something touching something, actual collisions are coming soon, I promise.) and shooting!
